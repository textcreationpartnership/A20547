            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Though thy know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge bee great, yet how much art thou ignorant of that thou mighteſt haue knowne, if thou hadſt been as diligent to ſeeke it, as God was to offer it vnto thee?

But in the courſe of ſinfulnes diddeſt thou not begin the race ſoone, and runne ſwiftly, and come backe againe ſlowlie?

                  <p>THis verſe, as it may appeare, is annexed to the former for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the point therein contained, that righteouſneſſe doth direct the way of vpright men, both to holy conuerſation, and happy ſtate. Againſt the which a doubt may riſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſhew of the contrarie, becauſe that good men are ſometimes plunged in great calamities, and ſometimes in great tranſgreſſions: and therefore their way ſeemeth as indirect, as if they were wicked, and their righteouſneſſe to doe them as little good as if they had none at all. Now this ſcruple he remoueth by ſhewing what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite it bringeth, that then eſpecially they haue the vſe of it, when they fall into ſuch diſtreſſes. For then the fruite thereof is moſt for their comfort when it ſhall deliuer them out of dangers, out of troubles, out of feares, out of temptations, out of ſinnes, and from deſtruction. Yet not by ſtrength of it owne, but by the power of God: not according to their worthines in way of deſert, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his goodnes in way of reward: not extended to all men that doe good workes, but reſtrained to vpright men whoſe workes are good. And for the clearer illuſtration of their bleſſed eſtate he bringeth in for contrarie, the miſerable condition of the wicked, oppoſing tranſgreſſours to vpright perſons: their miſchiefe to the others iuſtice: their perill to the others pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection: the one part incloſed in the net of troubles is yet aſſured of ſafe eſcape by meanes of their graces, the other abroad at the

This was that which made both <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Ieremie</hi> beſtirre them, when God ſhewed his anger to the one, and threatned to deſtroy the other, for being ſo backward to vndertake their miniſterie: Exp. 4. 14. Ier. 1. 17. And the wicked ſhall ſee by this, that hee is neither remiſſe toward all, nor partiall to any, when his commandement is not regarded. This ſeemeth to be one cauſe, why the Prophet that came to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel, and failed to fulfill that which was giuen him in charge, was ſo ſeuerely handled. He told <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> that God had ſtraightlie forbidden him either to eate or to drinke in that citie, and yet <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi> might heare that he had both eaten and drunken in the houſe of an other Prophet there, for which cauſe the Lord ſent a Lion to kil him, that it might be knowne to <hi>Ieroboam</hi> and others, <note place="margin">1.

They could neuer feele the comfort of their parents fauour, vnleſſe they ſometimes found the ſmart of their diſpleaſure.

They are deliuered from the firſt death, which hath power ouer all ſinfull men, in this world: and they ſhall neuer come into the ſecond, which is the portion of reprobates in the world to come.

It is therefore a point of certentie to them that lay hold on it: It is a point of difficultie, and not eaſilie beleeued: ſithence God to helpe our hearts doth againe, and againe redouble it: and it is a point of great importance, requiring a ſerious and conſtant me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, without which men grow barren, and careleſſe in doing all good dueties: and by which they are made rich and plentifull in all holy ſeruices. The conſideration of life, and of ſuch a life will incourage the heart, and open the mouth, and ſtrengthen the hands, and make the feete nimble to runne in the waies of righteouſnes: all that they can doe in obedience, they will account too little, and nothing that they ſuffer for wel-doing, they will thinke to much.</p>
